# Keycloak Last Login Event Listener

Sets a last login attribute on the user model when they login.

This is based on the templates provided by [zonaut](https://github.com/zonaut/keycloak-extensions).

Building can be done via `mvn clean install`. Please take a look at the aforementioned repository for a far more detailed introduction.

This repository will most likely not keep up with the keycloak release cycle. You have been warned.
